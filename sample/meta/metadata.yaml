abstract: >
    This example ilustrates capabilities of the technical documentation
    authoring tool that uses Markdown to write contents and Pandoc to 
    transform it into a PDF file for distribution.

    The goal of the tool is to simplify a process of creation of a technical
    documentation and allow authors to concentrate on a content rather than a
    styling of resulting documents.
